              I have over 3 years of experience working with various network
              environments, including MikroTik routers, Ruijie access points,
              TP-Link routers, and Huawei switches. My current role as IT
              Supervisor involves managing and configuring complete network
              systems, CCTV, fingerprint, and IPPBX systems â€” ensuring high
              availability and security across all devices.

              My strongest areas are MikroTik RouterOS, Ruijie AP, and TP-Link
              networks, where I have implemented solutions that improved
              performance, reliability, and network efficiency. I take pride in
              being a fast learner, adaptable to new technologies, and dedicated
              to delivering quality results under pressure.
